# Miscellaneous
An assortment of various things I've developed.


## Logisim CPU Design (WIP)
A 32-bit CPU capable of basic arithmetic (addition and subtraction), logic functions (or, and, xor, not), and shifting. Created in [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) using gate-level structure. 

## Node Graph Project (WIP)
A node graph utility built using [Processing](https://processing.org/). Inspired by tools like [GraphOnline](https://graphonline.ru/en/)
